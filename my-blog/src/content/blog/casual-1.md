# That Feeling After a Long Holiday

---

**A:** Ugh. Back to work tomorrow.

**B:** I know. This holiday went by _so fast_.

**A:** I didn't even _do anything special_, but I'm exhausted.

**B:** Same. I think I _over-rested_.

**A:** Is that even a thing?

**B:** It has to be. I can't _get back into work mode_ at all.

**A:** I tried to _get things ready_ last night, but I just watched TV.

**B:** Ha. I _set my alarm_ and immediately felt depressed.

**A:** The worst part is, _nothing actually changed_. Same job, same desk.

**B:** Yeah, but somehow it feels _harder to face_.

**A:** I need like… one more day.

**B:** Everyone does. That's why it's called the _holiday blues_.
