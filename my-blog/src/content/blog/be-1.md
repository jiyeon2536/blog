**[한글 요약]** 중요한 선례가 될 "벨웨더(bellwether, 판례 선도)" 재판이 로스앤젤레스에서 진행 중이다. 메타 CEO 마크 저커버그는 소셜 미디어 플랫폼이 의도적으로 중독성을 갖도록 설계됐으며 청소년의 정신 건강에 해를 끼쳤다는 주장을 두고 배심원단 앞에서 증언했다. 내부 문서에 따르면 메타는 잠재적인 위험성을 인지하고 있었음에도 안전보다 사용자 참여 극대화를 우선시한 것으로 보인다. 이 소송은 20세 여성 케일리와 그녀의 어머니가 제기한 것으로, 유사한 민사 소송 1,500여 건 중 하나이며, 1990년대 대형 담배 소송과 직접적으로 비교된다. 당시 담배 소송은 결국 업계 전반에 걸친 대대적인 변화를 이끌어냈다. 이번 재판의 결과는 향후 법적 전략, 재정적 배상 책임, 그리고 소셜 미디어 업계 전반의 플랫폼 설계 방식에 광범위한 영향을 미칠 수 있다.

# Big Tech's Big Tobacco Moment — The Social Media Addiction Trial

---

## 1. Article Summary

A landmark "bellwether" trial is underway in Los Angeles, where Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified before a jury over claims that social media platforms were intentionally designed to be addictive and harmed the mental health of young users. Internal documents suggest Meta knew about potential harms but prioritized user engagement over safety. The case, brought by a 20-year-old woman named Kaley and her mother, is one of over 1,500 similar civil lawsuits, and draws direct comparisons to the 1990s Big Tobacco litigation that ultimately forced sweeping industry change. The outcome of this bellwether trial could shape legal strategy, financial liability, and platform design across the entire social media industry.

## 2. Warm-Up Questions

1. If a product is legal, widely used, and generates genuine value for many people, at what point — if ever — does a company become morally responsible for the harm it causes to a subset of users?
2. Do you think the comparison between social media and tobacco is a fair analogy, or is it being used strategically by lawyers to trigger emotional bias in juries?

## 3. Key Expressions

**1. bellwether (n.)** A case, event, or figure that leads or indicates a trend; a predictor of future outcomes.

> "The court selected this case as a bellwether trial because its verdict will influence how hundreds of similar lawsuits are handled."

**2. chain reaction (n.)** A sequence of events in which each event triggers the next, often with escalating consequences.

> "Regulators fear that one guilty verdict could trigger a chain reaction of litigation that destabilizes the entire platform economy."

**4. whistleblower (n.)** A person who exposes wrongdoing within an organization, often at personal risk.

**5. cherrypick (v.)** To selectively choose data or evidence that supports a particular argument while ignoring contradictory evidence.

**6. novel approach (n. phrase)** A strategy or method that has not been tried before in a given legal or professional context.

> "Bypassing Section 230 by targeting product design rather than user content was a novel approach that caught the tech companies off guard."

**7. shield from liability (phrase)** To legally protect an entity from being held responsible for harm.

> "Section 230 was originally intended to shield platforms from liability for third-party content, not for their own design decisions."

**8. conclusive evidence (n. phrase)** Evidence that is definitive and leaves no room for reasonable doubt.

> "The defense maintained there was no conclusive evidence directly linking algorithmic design to clinical addiction."

**9. put on the hook (idiom)** To make someone financially or legally responsible for something.

**13. disregard (v.)** To deliberately ignore or pay no attention to something, especially advice or evidence.

> "Internal emails suggested executives had disregarded recommendations from their own safety researchers."

**14. liability (n.)** Legal responsibility for one's actions or omissions, particularly in relation to harm caused.

> "The central question of the trial is whether platform liability extends to design choices that foreseeably harm vulnerable users."

**15. avenue for change (n. phrase)** A pathway or mechanism through which reform or progress can be achieved.

> "In highly lobbied industries, civil litigation has historically proven to be a more reliable avenue for change than legislation."

## 5. Discussion Questions

1. Meta argues the internal documents presented in court are "cherrypicked and out of date." How should a jury — composed of non-technical laypeople — evaluate technical and organizational evidence they don't fully understand?

2. The tobacco analogy is being used deliberately to frame jury perception. To what extent do you think legal analogies shape verdicts — and is that appropriate in a justice system?

3. If this case results in billion-dollar damages, do you think platforms would actually redesign their products, or simply absorb the cost as a business expense and continue as before?

4. The article notes that safety features like parental controls place the burden on parents and teens. Is it reasonable to expect a 13-year-old to opt into their own digital safety, or is that an inherent design failure?

5. Meta claims social media has genuine benefits — creativity, community, self-expression. How do you weigh demonstrated social benefits against probabilistic harms to a minority of vulnerable users?

6. Zuckerberg testified that Meta has "evolved" its approach to age verification. Is that evolution evidence of good faith, or evidence that the problem was knowable and preventable far earlier?

7. TikTok and Snap settled before trial. What does early settlement signal about a company's assessment of its own legal exposure — and does it function as an implicit admission?

8. If you were advising Meta's product team after this trial, what structural changes — not just UI features — would you recommend to genuinely reduce harm without gutting engagement?

9. YouTube argues it is more of an entertainment platform than a social network and therefore deserves different legal treatment. Do you find that distinction meaningful or is it a deliberate reframing?

10. The trial involves a jury of ordinary citizens making decisions about algorithmic design, neuroscience, and corporate intent. Is a jury trial the appropriate format for this kind of technologically complex case?

11. Frances Haugen's leaked documents became central evidence four years later. What does this say about the role of whistleblowers in holding tech companies accountable — and what systemic protections should exist for them?

12. Some health experts agree that social media has mental health benefits; others call for tobacco-style warning labels. If warning labels were mandated, what exactly should they say — and would they actually change user behavior?

13. If platforms are ultimately found liable for addictive design, would that legal logic apply to other industries — gaming, streaming, gambling apps — or is social media unique in its risk profile?

14. This trial is happening in the U.S. How do you think the outcome will affect regulatory approaches in the EU, South Korea, or other markets that already have stricter digital safety frameworks?
